[Verse 1]
Lately, I'm so caught up in the moment
I know
There’s so much in my head can't put it down
I know
Too much on my chest, shoulders tight
Getting heavy, turn on the light

[Pre-Chorus]
I need a little smoothing out the rough
I want relief, I want to feel your touch
I want release, a little something in the cut
Ah, ah-ah, ah

[Chorus]
I came here to get some dopamine
Ah-ah, ah, ah-ah, ah, ah, ah
Make it go all night, no gasoline
Ah-ah, ah, ah-ah, ah, ah, ah
Yes, I know you've been
Waiting for me (I need)
Ah-ah, ah, ah-ah, ah, ah, ah ( I need, I need)
I came here to get some dopamine (Dopamine)
Ah-ah, ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah (I need, I need, I need dopamine)
I came here to (Uh, uh)

[Verse 2]
You telling me sweet nothings
Got me all right
Ain’t no time for talking
When we're tongue-tied
Holding on my head close my eyes
When it's raining, you're my sunshine

[Pre-Chorus]
I need a little smoothing out the rough
I want relief, I want to feel your touch
I want release (Release), a little something in the cut
Ah, ah-ah, ah

[Chorus]
I came here to get some dopamine
Ah-ah, ah, ah-ah, ah, ah, ah
Make it go all night, no gasoline
Ah-ah, ah, ah-ah, ah, ah, ah
Yes, I know you've been waiting for me (I need)
Ah-ah, ah, ah-ah, ah, ah, ah (I need, I need)
I came here to get some dopamine (I need)
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah (I need, I need dopamine)
I came here to (Uh, uh)

[Post-Chorus]
I came here to (Uh, uh)
I came here to
I came here to (Uh, uh)
I came here to (Uh, uh)
I came here to (Uh, uh)
I came here to
I came here to (Uh, uh)
(Dopamine)
